<h3>Evgeny Zamiatin (1884-1937)</h3>

<ul> 
    <li>Modernism - focus on language, use of skaz (Bakhtin would call it "double-voicedness" when the author's voice dominates the voice of the character); dystopian characters from the future and instantiation of 1920s ornamentalist prose</li>
    <li>Modernism - ideology of alienation from traditional morality</li>
    <li>We (1921) - dystopia of totalitarian society</li>
    <li>Satire </li>
    <li>Anxiety of belonging - being a loyal state engineer and being in love with a rebel; conflicted; insufficiency of language leads to astounding images</li>
    <li>Skaz - we know immediately that this is not Zamitain, a different voice - diary writer; but reader can't identify with him; reader feels this distance</li>
    <li>New sexuality - too graphic from Soviet official point of view</li>
