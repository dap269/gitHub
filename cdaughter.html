<h2>Captain's Daughter (1836)</h2>

<ul>Major ideas

	<li>Genre of historical novel, in the style of Walter Scott (the first historical novel is titled Waverley (1814) - mix of historical and fictional characters (historical characters being secondary to fictional)</li>
	<li>Chance encounters and role of fate (feature of Romanticism)</li>
		<li>Mark Altshuller says that the action is usually set 60 years before </li>
			<li>Local color - the use of dialect words; Умет (inn) - local dialect of Russian; authenticity and realism as understood by Romantics</li>
				<li>Protagonist is caught between two fighting forces and finds positive things in both; romantic ambiguity</li>
					<li>Folk tale quality - historical figures as magical helpers</li>
	
</ul>
