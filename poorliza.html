<h1>Poor Liza (1792)</h1>

<ul>Features of Sentimentalist tale

	<li>Concern with human emotions, in addition to reason</li>
	<li>Concern with authenticity, hence first-person narration</li>
	<li>Telling names (inherited from Neoclassicism) i.e. Erast</li>
	<li>Common people become heroes, even women</li>
	<li>Nature is a character and mirrors human emotions i.e. A storm happens when Liza loses her virginity (pathetic fallacy)</li>
</ul>
