<h3>Isaac Babel (1894-1940)</h3>

<ul> 
    <li>Modernism - focus on language, use of skaz (Bakhtin would call it "double-voicedness" when the author's voice dominates the voice of the character) (Cossacks, Odessa gangsters), and instantiation of 1920s ornamentalist prose</li>
    <li>Modernism - ideology of alienation from traditional morality</li>
    <li>Two major cycles - Red Cavalry and Odessa Stories; short stories as snapshots edited together i.e. montage prose</li>
    <li>Aestheticization of violence - very visual </li>
    <li>Anxiety of belonging - being Jewish, trying to belong to Cossacks, natural enemies of Jews (My First Goose)</li>
    
    


</ul>
